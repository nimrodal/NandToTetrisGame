Red Light - Green Light game ("Dag maluach" in hebrew)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation
-----------
This game took a lot of inspiration from Netflix's most-watched show "Squid Game".
One of the show's episodes is a game which is similar to "dag maluch" in Israel,
and is called "red light - green light" around the globe.

The player needs to cross the finish line when the doll can't see.

If the doll is blindfolded (green-light mode) the player can proceed,
but the doll can see (red-light mode) the player and they advance, the game is over.

Multiple players can register, and the game keeps score for every player.

The player's score is the average number of green-light sessions it took to win a game.
A lost game is not counted.

The scores are kept in a linked list of players, and each node in this list is a linked list of scores itself.

The drawings access the screen memory directly.
